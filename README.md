# Neural-Network
To build a neural network (NN) having two hidden layers, besides the input and output layers using Sigmoid, Tanh and ReLu as activation fumctions. This NN is tested on Car Evaluation, Iris and Adult Census Income Datasets.

Development Environment:
Program is developed in python and tested in Windows Operating System.

Usage:
The program is compatible with Python 3.5 and 3.6.

Prerequisite:
Train.CSV and Test.CSV should present in the same folder as the code, NeuralNet.py

Steps to COMPILE and RUN:
python NeuralNet.py <activation function>

<activation function> takes sigmoid, tanh and relu as values
